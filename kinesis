Be able to produce and consume kinesis data streams
Keep stream open -> needed for KDF as well

Base64 encoding/decoding : raw <--> textual data = https://www.base64decode.org/

Figure out good target stores to load KDF data to 
- databases : Redshift

Figure out multiple sources ( not just KDS ) 
Buffer for accumulations before target delivery in KDF
Set up buffer intervals ( 1 min - 15 minutes for buffer flush to destinations such as S3 ) 

Enable compression before storage via KDS ( cost savings ) 
Any IAM roles : KDF <--> S3 target buckets

Need new data to KDS to see in KDF
